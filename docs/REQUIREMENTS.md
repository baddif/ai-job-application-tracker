## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The Job Application Tracker helps users record and manage their job applications, track progress across different hiring stages, and keep notes on job requirements and personal feedback.
### 1.2 Background / Motivation
As a job seeker, managing and tracking numerous job applications becomes increasingly tedious and overwhelming, particularly when pursuing remote opportunities. The modern job search often requires submitting hundreds of applications before securing a position, creating significant organizational challenges.

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Inadequate Tracking Tools**: Traditional methods like Excel spreadsheets are insufficient for managing complex application data and workflows
- **Calendar Integration Issues**: Interview schedules and important deadlines require immediate calendar entries to prevent missed opportunities
- **Information Retrieval Challenges**: Recalling specific job details, required skills, and previous interview feedback becomes difficult over time
- **Context Loss**: Critical information about job descriptions and interview history is often scattered or lost

**Project Vision:**
This project aims to create an intuitive, comprehensive system that streamlines the job application tracking process. By centralizing all job-related information and providing smart organizational features, we help job seekers maintain better control over their job search journey and improve their chances of success.
### 1.3 Scope

This system provides comprehensive job application tracking capabilities with the following core functionalities and boundaries:

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Application Management**: Record, edit, and organize job applications with detailed information
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor application status through hiring stages (Applied, Phone Screen, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
- **Information Storage**: Maintain job requirements, descriptions, and personal notes for each application
- **Calendar Integration**: Schedule and manage interview appointments, deadlines, and important dates
- **Application Limits Tracking**: Monitor and enforce company-specific application restrictions (e.g., maximum applications per time period)
- **Multi-dimensional Views**: Organize and visualize data by skills, position types, companies, locations, and other criteria
- **Search and Filtering**: Quick access to applications based on various parameters

**Future Enhancements:**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Intelligent recommendations and application insights
- **Smart Resume Optimization**: AI-driven resume modifications tailored to specific positions
- **Interview Preparation**: Automated interview guides and skill development recommendations

**System Boundaries:**
- Primary focus on individual job seekers (single-user system initially)
- Local deployment with optional cloud demo
- Integration capabilities with calendar systems and email platforms
